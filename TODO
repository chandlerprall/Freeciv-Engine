TODO for Freeciv-Engine:

- Improve visual realism by using bumpmaps and heightmaps in WebGL.
- Fix performance issue when many tiles are rendered.
- Import blender models for units and cities.
- Add billboards for some terrain types.
- Zoom in and out. Zoom the map out a bit by default.
- Smooth looking fog-of-war.
- Integration between Freeciv-Engine and the Freeciv.net game engine.
